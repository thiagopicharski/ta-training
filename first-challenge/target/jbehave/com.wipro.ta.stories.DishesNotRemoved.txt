Scenario: Check that solution returns the correct coeffient for a valid input of dishes when anyone is removed
Examples:
Given a collection representing the linking value of each dish '<list>'
When evaluate the coeffient  of this collection
Then the  coeffient  should be equals to '<coeffient>'

|list|coeffient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], coeffient=17}
Given a collection representing the linking value of each dish '[-1,3,4]'
When evaluate the coeffient  of this collection
Then the  coeffient  should be equals to '17'
