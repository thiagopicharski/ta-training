Scenario: Check that solution returns the correct coefficient for a valid input of dishes.
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|coefficient|
|[-1,3,4]|17|

Example: {list=[-1,3,4], coefficient=17}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,3,4]'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '17'


Scenario: Check the solution when a dish must be removed and when anyone is removed
Examples:
Given a collection of dishes '<list>'
When i remove '<removeDishes>'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '<coefficient>'

|list|removeDishes|coefficient|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9, -7]|14|

Example: {list=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removeDishes=[-9, -7], coefficient=14}
Given a collection of dishes '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]'
When i remove '[-9, -7]'
When evaluate coefficient of the dishes
Then the coefficient of the list should be equals '14'
