Scenario: Check that solution returns the correct coeffient for a valid input of dishes when dishes are removed
Examples:
Given a collection representing the value of each dish '<list1>'
When i remove dishes from the collection '<removedDishes>' to evaluate the coeffient
Then the  coeffient of the list with removed values  should be equals to '<coeffient1>'

|list1|removedDishes|coeffient1|
|[-1,-9,0,5,-7]|[-9,-7]|14|

Example: {list1=[-1,-9,0,5,-7], removedDishes=[-9,-7], coeffient1=14}
Given a collection representing the value of each dish '[-1,-9,0,5,-7]'
When i remove dishes from the collection '[-9,-7]' to evaluate the coeffient
Then the  coeffient of the list with removed values  should be equals to '14'
