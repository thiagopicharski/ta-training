Scenario: Check that solution returns the correct coeffient for a valid input of dishes and when it removes some dishes from the list
Examples:
Given a list of '<dishesList>'
When it removes '<removeDishes>' from the list
And calculates the sum of like-to-time coefficient of dishes
Then it should return '<coefficient>'

|dishesList|removeDishes|coefficient|
|[1,3,5,2]|[2,5]|7|
|[4,-1,3,2]|[2]|11|
|[1,2,3,4]|[]|30|

Example: {dishesList=[1,3,5,2], removeDishes=[2,5], coefficient=7}
Given a list of '[1,3,5,2]'
When it removes '[2,5]' from the list
And calculates the sum of like-to-time coefficient of dishes
Then it should return '7'

Example: {dishesList=[4,-1,3,2], removeDishes=[2], coefficient=11}
Given a list of '[4,-1,3,2]'
When it removes '[2]' from the list
And calculates the sum of like-to-time coefficient of dishes
Then it should return '11'

Example: {dishesList=[1,2,3,4], removeDishes=[], coefficient=30}
Given a list of '[1,2,3,4]'
When it removes '[]' from the list
And calculates the sum of like-to-time coefficient of dishes
Then it should return '30'
