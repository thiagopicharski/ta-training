  <iWantTo keyword="So that">I can have the maximum coefficient for the dishes


!--As a user, I want to the total Like-to-time coefficient to be maximum for the dishes.
!--
!--I want to be able remove some dishes, in which case, a new coefficient is calculated using the left dishes.
!--The solution must calculate the maximum sum of all possible Like-to-time coefficients.
!--Input Specification: input: Array representing the linking value of each dish
!--
!--Output Specification: Return maximum like-to-time coefficient possible
!--
!--Acceptance Criteria:
!--
!--Check that solution returns the correct coeffient for a valid input of dishes
!--Check the solution when a dish must be removed and when anyone is removed
!--Examples:
!--
!--Not Removed: input: {-1,3,4} Output: 17
!--
!--Removed: input: {-1,-9,0,5,-7} #Dish -9 and -7 must be removed Output: 14
